# FinalProject

To run the python script, you need the required data files and secrets.py in one folder.
Required packages: Pandas, scipy, sklearn, numpy, geopandas, folium, sqlalchemy, and altair. The required files are coffee_pr_2016.csv and a set of 8 geodata files (they need to be in the same folder). The set of geodata files are in a zipped file and needs to be decompressed first. 
The application interaction is through the command prompt. The user has the option of two datasets they could access - agricultural data or socio-economics data. The user type in the number for the dataset and choose the variable they want to access and visualize.
